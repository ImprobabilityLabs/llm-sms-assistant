# Support
Since I am extremely lazy I am not going to offer any support. Well maybe every once-n-a while. It really depends on my mood.

That being said, time was spent documenting each script. This should allow the scripts to be easily understood and modified if needed.


# Donations
Many Bothans died getting this GPT4 SMS Assistant system with realtime info lookup to you, honor them by sending me some Bitcoin(BTC). ;)
